A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a 
particular parameter list and return type. When you instantiate a delegate, 
you can associate its instance with any method with a compatible signature and return type.
A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter 
list and return type. When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate its instance with any method with a compatible
 signature and return type. You can invoke (or call) the method through the delegate instance.
Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments to other methods. Event handlers are nothing more
 than methods that are invoked through delegates. You create a custom method, and a 
 class such as a windows control can call your method when a certain event occurs.
